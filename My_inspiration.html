        <h2>About light yagami</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Light Yagami is the main protagonist of the Death Note series. After discovering the Death Note, he decides to use it to rid the world of criminals. His killings are eventually labelled by people of Japan as the work of "Kira."

            <strong>Why i like him</strong>
        </span>
        <p>
            Light is a cookie cutter <em>psychopath</em>, but I like him, or realistically I like the way he was written. His intelligence, charm and manipulation have incredible ways of making you root for him while progressing through the show. Despite
            the universe he's apart of, the writers of Death Note make Light a character you can easily relate to, and I know that sounds crazy since he's a delusional teenager with unrealistic idealistic goals of a utopia that involves using a notebook
            that was created by the gods of death to take anyone's life if you know their name and face, however and whenever you want, but his very manipulation with society and the problematic views many people have with the fact that criminals are
            evil and need to be wiped out Which, realistically speaking is something that a huge part of the worlds population agree with considering the death penalty laws that are currently and were previously in place, and not to mention the continous
            protests held to bring it back in countries where it's been demolished.
